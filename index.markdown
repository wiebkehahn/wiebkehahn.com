### About

Wiebke (1987) is an art theorist and curator based in Berlin and Bielefeld. She holds a B.A. in Art History (Universität Leipzig) and two M.A.’s in Contemporary Art Theory (Goldsmiths College, University of London) and Culture Management and Culture Tourism (Europa-Universität Viadrina, Frankfurt (Oder)). She is currently completing her Ph.D. at Freie Universität, Berlin, which explores the materiality and political aesthetic of interventionist art practices in the public sphere. Further research interests focus on artistic utopias and spaces of remembrance, immersion and transcultural dynamics in modern society. At the moment, she is a curator at Museum Marta Herford.

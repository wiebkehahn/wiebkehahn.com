  Wiebke (1987) is an art theorist and curator based in Berlin and Bielefeld. 
  She holds a B.A. in Art History (Universität Leipzig) and two M.A.’s in 
  Contemporary Art Theory (Goldsmiths College, University of London) and 
  Culture Management and Culture Tourism (Europa-Universität Viadrina, 
  Frankfurt (Oder)). She is currently completing her Ph.D. at Freie Universität,
  Berlin, which explores the materiality and political aesthetic of interventionist
  art practices in the public sphere. Further research interests focus on artistic
  utopias and spaces of remembrance, immersion and transcultural dynamics in modern
  society. At the moment, she is a curator at Museum Marta Herford.
